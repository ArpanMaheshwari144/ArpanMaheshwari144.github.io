                        <h3>So, What Does “Web Accessibility” Refer To?</h3>
                        <p>
                            In simpler words, “web accessibility” is an effective way to ensure “everyone on the web”
                            can
                            effortlessly access and use any forms of digital media. It can be a website, or it can be
                            any
                            software application as well.

                            Now, why did I focus on the part “everyone on the web”?

                            Well, you have to understand that people with any physical disability or cognitive
                            limitations
                            use the web too. A recently made research report highlights that in the United Kingdom;
                            nearly
                            11 million people have some kind of disability. And it does not mean that every one of them
                            cannot just use the web!

                            Of course, many disables use the internet. And they too are part of the audience that seeks
                            favors through digital services. Hence, it is the responsibility of the trades to consider
                            them
                            and craft a hassle-free journey for them on the web.

                            This is why paying mind to the web reachability practice while building a website makes sure
                            that everyone can get the most out of the website and interact with the site smoothly.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How The User Experience Gets Affected By Disability?</h3>
                        <p>
                            To guarantee properly done accessibility, reaching the root of what is causing the
                            hindrance,
                            what is stopping the flawless access is kind of essential. Only then figuring out the base
                            of
                            the issues and coming up with the right way out to resolve the barrier becomes easier.

                            <br>
                            So, here is a list of some accessibility challenges.<br>

                            ▢ Users with visual impairment may face problems while reading a text. Maybe the size of
                            the text needs to be increased. Or maybe they need screen readers!<br>
                            ▢ Users, who suffer from color blindness, cannot distinguish between the colors. They face
                            problems in distinguishing text blocks and its background.<br>
                            ▢ Users with dyslexia suffer from not being able to read and spell properly.<br>
                            ▢ There are users out there who feel troubled to click on any link or any small navigation
                            icons.<br>
                            ▢ You add video and audio content to your website to keep your visitors engaged. But people
                            with
                            hearing troubles cannot access it!<br>
                            ▢ Any users who come under the aforementioned categories need assistive technologies so
                            that
                            they
                            can browse the web easily.
                        </p>

                        <h3>A Sneak Peek to Some Assistive Technologies</h3>
                        <p>
                            Continuing from the above point, I would like to draw your attention to some advanced
                            technologies that help disable users to get a smooth web browsing experience.<br>

                            ▢ Braille Terminals or Braille Keyboards<br>
                            ▢ Screen Reader Software<br>
                            ▢ Speech Recognition Software<br>
                            ▢ Sign Language or using subtitles for videos on a website<br>
                            ▢ Screen Magnification Software<br>
                            ▢ Keyboard Overlays<br>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Now, Why Is Web Accessibility Necessary?</h3>
                        <p>
                            See, today, the Internet and Web are crucial parts of everyone’s lives, and it doesn’t need
                            any
                            special explanation. These are the valuable resources that we all need in our lives.

                            Be it for the government or business organizations, be it for employment or for students to
                            learn better, be it for the healthcare industry to simply recreational activities – to do
                            anything, we access these resources.

                            Now, do you think it should be accessible to only the people who do not have any kind of
                            disabilities? Of course not!

                            You have to keep in mind two factors i.e. an equal opportunity for everyone along with
                            giving
                            everyone the same access. You need to understand that internet access is not considered as a
                            privilege. Rather, it is a right for everyone. And by abiding by the principles of web
                            design
                            that supports accessibility, you can make sure of the fact that your digital presence is
                            accessible to anyone irrespective of their abilities.

                            Other than this, there are some business benefits of web accessibility too.
                        </p>

                        <h3>A Competitive Advantage in the Market</h3>
                        <p>
                            Honestly, most of the websites built out there are not accessible to “everyone”! In such a
                            scenario, if you make your website keeping the web accessibility factor in mind, it can
                            reach a
                            broader target audience.

                            Reshaping a shopping website for the disabled buyers out there will increase client numbers
                            on
                            the website, as well as the popularity of it. All because the website is usable for both
                            enabled
                            and disabled audiences.

                            This is definitely an added advantage for you over your competitors who are still not giving
                            that much importance to the web accessibility.

                        <h3>Better Accessibility Ensures Better Usability</h3>
                        <p>
                            The accessibility of your website is high- means; more people can visit and navigate through
                            your website. And when the website traffic is high, the chances of business conversion are
                            high
                            too. The math here is as simple as that!

                            These accessibility and usability, even though these two are different from each other, they
                            kind of have the same objectives. And the objective is to devise engaging and impressive
                            user
                            experience. These two factors ensure that your website functions properly and delivers a
                            seamless UX to the visitors.

                        <h3>Americans with Disabilities Act</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the US, this law protects the rights of disabled ones. So, ignoring them as a potential
                            audience can have the same impact as violating the law. And this is absolutely wrong. To
                            abide
                            by this rule and to avert the legal consequences, trades should consider the disabled ones
                            too.
                        </p>


                        <h3>Things to Consider While Making Your Website Accessible to Everyone</h3>
                        <p>
                            So far, you got to know what web accessibility is and how it holds a major significance in
                            the
                            website development and design industry. Now, find out how you can do it i.e. making the
                            website
                            accessible to everyone.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Title Tag</h3>
                        <p>
                            You already know how important the title tag is for SEO purposes. This is crucial for
                            letting
                            Google know and understand “about the web page”. Now, while integrating web accessibility
                            too,
                            this title tag plays a major role.

                            The ‘Screen Readers’ prefer having a title tag. It aids the disabled who use screen readers
                            to
                            access a site.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Using Default HTML Tags</h3>
                        <p>
                            Disables need such tech-help that aid them to go through a site. They prefer taking
                            assistance
                            from ‘Screen Readers’. Now, this device follows a specific method while going through every
                            component on a page along with the texts. When it fails to decipher an element, the one
                            using
                            the device fails to comprehend it too resulting in a poor experience for the users.

                            Opting for HTML tags that are set by default is a way out to this problem.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>
                        <p>
                            A site that anyone can navigate seamlessly with just a keyboard is an example of how
                            actually it
                            should be devised.

                            However, there is an issue with such navigation buttons that are animated. Usually, screen
                            readers cannot understand that. So, it is advisable not to use such buttons as the dropdowns
                            to
                            ensure better accessibility.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Do Not Forget to Use Subtitles</h3>
                        <p>
                            According to the recent practices, applying audio and video elements to entertain and
                            interact
                            with the visitors on the site is a popular practice. With this, the structure of a website
                            will
                            not fail.

                            Now, how about a user who has hearing problems? This is why you should always include
                            subtitles.

                            With video transcription, the website enables Google to read the transcriptions. This allows
                            for
                            better rankings on the SERPs.
                        </p>
